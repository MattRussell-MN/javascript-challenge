Homework 14 (Javascript) - Cohort #8

For this assignment, I did not create my own HTML file. However, I added Version 5.0 of D3 to my index.html and removed the old version. Trying to get into the habit of checking this as I know it is vital for future assignments. 

Please run the .js file "FinalApp" to ensure my code works. 

I also only did Level 1 of this assignment due to time constraints. I may try to tackle Level 2 on my own time and convenience as we have learned the tools and code to execute this in class.
